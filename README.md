# Online-code-editor
It is a tool that resides on a remote server and is accessible via browsers.
It involves the basic use of all of HTML,CSS,Javascript languages.
It lets us put a whole HTML program (including CSS, HTML, Images, JavaScript) into a standalone Windows app, which could be executed like all Windows programs. The tool lets you customize the resulting executable file, by modifying the icon and setting up several other options. You could, for example, disallow or allow the option to print HTML pages. Also, you may specify types of files to automatically execute or extract.
